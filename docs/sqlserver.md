## **Architecture Overview**  

![Azure SQL Architecture](./images/azure-sql.png "Azure SQL Server Architecture")  

### **Components**  

1. **Azure SQL Server**  
   - A fully managed SQL database service with built-in high availability and disaster recovery.  

2. **Virtual Network Integration**  
   - Allows secure communication by integrating SQL Server with private endpoints.  

3. **Azure Key Vault**  
   - Manages encryption keys and secrets for secure access to databases.  

4. **Azure Monitor**  
   - Collects logs and metrics for real-time monitoring and troubleshooting.  

5. **Azure Defender for SQL**  
   - Provides advanced security features such as vulnerability assessments and threat detection.  

6. **Pipelines (CI/CD)**  
   - Automates database deployments and schema updates using Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions.  

7. **Geo-Replication**  
   - Enables data replication across regions for disaster recovery and global access.

## **Key Features**  

### 1. **High Availability**  
   - ✅ Azure SQL Server ensures a 99.99% SLA with automated backups and geo-redundant storage.  

### 2. **Authentication and Access Control**  
   - ✅ **Azure AD Authentication**: Integrated with Microsoft Entra ID for seamless user and service authentication.  
   - ✅ **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Grants granular access to resources based on user roles.  

### 3. **Security Features**  
   - ✅ **Data Encryption**: Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) protects data at rest.  
   - ✅ **Always Encrypted**: Ensures sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.  
   - ✅ **Firewall Rules**: Restricts access to specific IP addresses or Azure VNets.  
   - ✅ **Threat Protection**: Defender for SQL identifies and mitigates potential vulnerabilities.  

### 4. **Networking**  
   - ✅ **Private Endpoints**: Integrates with Azure Virtual Network for private connectivity.  
   - ✅ **Public Access Restrictions**: Optionally disable public access to enhance security.  

### 5. **Performance Tuning**  
   - ✅ **Auto-Tuning**: Monitors and optimizes database performance automatically.  
   - ✅ **Elastic Pools**: Balances performance across multiple databases within a pool.  
   - ✅ **Query Store**: Tracks query performance over time to aid troubleshooting.  

### 6. **Monitoring and Diagnostics**  
   - ✅ **Azure Monitor Logs**: Provides insights into query performance and system metrics.  
   - ✅ **Diagnostic Settings**: Captures logs and metrics for advanced troubleshooting.  

### 7. **Backups and Recovery**  
   - ✅ **Automated Backups**: Supports point-in-time recovery with up to 35 days of retention.  
   - ✅ **Geo-Redundant Backup**: Ensures data protection across regions for disaster recovery.  

### 8. **Compliance**  
   - ✅ **Industry Standards**: Aligns with compliance frameworks such as ISO, SOC, and GDPR.  
   - ✅ **Data Residency**: Enables configuration for regional or global data residency requirements.  

### 9. **CI/CD Pipelines**  
   - ✅ Automates schema updates and migrations using DevOps tools.  
   - ✅ Integrates with tools like **Azure DevOps**, **Flyway**, or **Liquibase** for database deployment.

## **Implementation Considerations**  

### **Network Configuration**  
- Use **private endpoints** to eliminate exposure to the public internet.  
- Restrict traffic using **firewall rules** or **service endpoints** for virtual networks.  

### **Cost Optimization**  
- Choose the right pricing tier based on workload:  
  - **General Purpose**: Balanced performance for most workloads.  
  - **Business Critical**: High performance with added resiliency.  
  - **Hyperscale**: Scales storage independently for large datasets.  

### **Scalability**  
- Configure **elastic pools** to share resources efficiently across multiple databases.  
- Use **vCore-based pricing** for predictable and scalable performance.
